# K-means-Clustering-From-Scratch

Description:
This project is dedicated to the comprehensive implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch, highlighting each step's intricacies. The K-Means algorithm involves selecting the optimal number of clusters, initializing centroids through meticulous sampling, assigning points to clusters based on precise Euclidean distances, and iteratively updating centroids. This meticulous process continues until convergence is achieved.

Algorithm Steps:

Select the Number of Clusters, k: Determine the target number of clusters for the dataset.
Select k Points at Random: Initialize k centroids with meticulous precision by selecting points from the dataset.
Make k Clusters: Assign each item to its nearest cluster centroid with precise Euclidean distances.
Compute New Centroid of Each Cluster: Recalculate centroids with meticulous precision by computing the mean point of all items in each cluster.
Repeat Steps 3â€“4: Iteratively apply steps 3 and 4 until achieving convergence.
Terms Description:

points: Unwavering selection of unlabelled items or training instances for precise clustering.
k: User-specified target number of clusters.
centroids: Meticulously calculated mean vectors for all items assigned to a given cluster.
labels: Labels with meticulous accuracy, specifying each point's cluster membership.
